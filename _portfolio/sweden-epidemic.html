During the fall of 2009 there was a large pandemic of the H1N1-virus, commonly known as the swine-flu. 
During this pandemic it is estimated that about 1.5 million people in Sweden were infected. 
As an attempt to stop the pandemic and reduce excess mortality the government issued a vaccination program beginning in week 40 of 2009. 
During the weeks that followed they vaccinated more than 60% of the Swedish population. 

For this project, the goal was to simulate the pandemic, focusing on learning the network structure characteristics and disease-dynamics 
parameters of the pandemic in Sweden 2009.

At first step, it was done by using a SIR model on a random graph. Then, as second step, a more complicated graph was used: starting from
a complete graph, by using a "preferential attachement" model, we tried to simulate the social structure, first as a fixed structure (one graph, the same, for the 
entire evolution) then with a dynamic one (graph, like real social structure, changed continuously).

Starting from this behavior, we move for a SIR model to a SIR with vaccinations model.

As a final step, we apply the concept of "community network" to our problem:
in order to define the graph as similar as possibile to the swedish society, we start from a list of all regions in Sweden, 
each one characterized by the population density and by the distances in km to all the other ones. 
Each region defines a comunity; the number of edges and the average degree are related to the population density. Then we create links among regions,
defining an interconnection parameter for each couple of regions, that is function of their mutual distance.
The vaccination simulation has then been repeated on this graph.
