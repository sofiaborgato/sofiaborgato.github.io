title: "Breast Cancer classification task"
excerpt: "The aim of this analysis is to perform a binary classification task and point out which features are most relevant in predicting if a mass is malignant or benign. Different strategies of features selection are compared, both unsupervised and  supervised. Also different machine learning approach are presented.

Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women worldwide, representing the majority of new cancer cases and cancer-related deaths according to global statistics.
The Breast Cancer is publicly available and was created by Dr. William H. Wolberg, physician at the University Of Wisconsin Hospital at Madison, Wisconsin, USA. To create the dataset Dr. Wolberg used fluid samples, taken from patients with solid breast masses and an easy-to-use graphical computer program called Xcyt, which is capable of perform the analysis of cytological features based on a digital scan. The program uses a curve-fitting algorithm, to compute ten features from each one of the cells in the sample, than it calculates the mean value, extreme value and standard error of each feature for the image, returning a 30 real-valuated vector.
